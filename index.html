            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a software developer living in Eden Prairie, MN. 
        I have a double major in International Business and Marketing with a minor in Art from St. Mary's University in Winona, MN.
        I am currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>It didn’t take long to realize my passion for programming. As a student at the University of Minnesota, I’ve begun to hone my programming skills to build upon this passion. </p>
        <p>When I'm not programming, I like to switch gears entirely and enjoy the great outdoors. I've traveled all over the US to camp, backpack, snowboard, kayak, and bike. I love to push my limits and I'm always looking forward for the next adventure.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a new developer who will continue to push the efficiency and practicality of any project, please reach out! I am eager to collaborate with like-minded developers and begin my new career in software engineering.</p>
